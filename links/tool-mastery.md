## Monospace Ligatures

> What? Why? Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. Ligatures are just a font rendering feature: The underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. The help to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like `..` or `//`, ligatures allow us to correct spacing. It's as easy as installing a TTF font on your computer.
