## Simple Immediate Responses

> Why? Because any feedback is appreciated and better than no feedback at all, even if you don't have the answer

> ### Bad
>
> If it's not obvious for the asking person that you're not concerned, not answering always keeps them in limbo.
>
> ### Good
>
> Use 😶 \(`:no_mouth:`\) to show that you've read but are currently not planning on responding.  
> This takes the asker out of limbo.
>
> ### Even Better

> * Use ✅ \(`:white_check_mark:`\) to agree or ❌ \(`:x:`\) to disagree
> * Use ⌛️ \(`:hourglass:`\) to show that you will respond at a later point in time

## Announcements with read-acknowledgements using avatar emoji

> Why? Distributing small pieces of important information can take a lot of time and is no fun.
